# LearnAndEarn Node.js Migration - TODO List

This document outlines the tasks required to migrate the LearnAndEarn Odoo project to Node.js.

## High Priority

- [x] Analyze existing Odoo 17.0 project structure and custom modules (especially `_our_seewald_youtube`).
- [x] Understand the PostgreSQL database schema and identify all relevant "our_" prefixed tables.
- [x] Set up a basic Node.js project environment for the migration. we start with a search interface over the videos.
- [x] Now lets understand the main exersice for students always used in all different exercises. Clicking on sentences opens a dictation window with the clicked text
- [x] Implement user authentication system with "our_" naming convention for tables

## Completed Features

- Responsive grid layout
- Video detail pages with YouTube embedding

### Speech Recognition Dictation ✅
- Clickable sentences in summaries
- Partial sentence selection for focused practice
- Dual-speed audio playback (normal and slow)
- Real-time German speech recognition

## Low Priority

- [ ] Develop interactive exercise modules (cloze tests, comprehension questions).
- [ ] Implement gamification features (points and progress tracking).
- [ ] Implement multi-language support (German, English, Vietnamese, Arabic, Spanish, French).
- [ ] Design and develop separate interfaces for Teacher and Student roles.
