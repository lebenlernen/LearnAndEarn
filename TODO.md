# LearnAndEarn Node.js Migration - TODO List

This document outlines the tasks required to migrate the LearnAndEarn Odoo project to Node.js.

## High Priority

- [x] Analyze existing Odoo 17.0 project structure and custom modules (especially `_our_seewald_youtube`).
- [x] Understand the PostgreSQL database schema and identify all relevant "our_" prefixed tables.
- [x] Set up a basic Node.js project environment for the migration. we start with a search interface over the videos.
- [x] Now lets understand the main exersice for students always used in all different exercises. Clicking on sentences opens a dictation window with the clicked text
- [x] Implement user authentication system with "our_" naming convention for tables
- [x] Implement multi-role system (student, teacher, admin)
- [x] Create admin panel for user management
- [x] Add navigation improvements and modern UI design

## In Progress

### Vokabeln (Vocabulary) with Spaced Repetition Learning ðŸš§

#### Core Principle: "Always Speaking" - ALL interactions must support speech input/output

#### Database Design Tasks
- [x] Analyze existing tables:
  - [x] `our_videos_base_words` - unique base words per video with SpaCy analysis
  - [x] `our_vocabulary_practice` - SRS tracking for user progress
- [x] Added `language_target` column to `our_videos_base_words` table
- [ ] Design solution for polysemous words (e.g., "Bank" = financial/bench)
- [x] Create word-video frequency tracking table (exists in base_words)
- [x] Design SRS tracking tables for user progress (our_vocabulary_practice)

#### Two Learning Modes
- [ ] **Word Mode**: Individual vocabulary with speech
  - [ ] Display word in context sentence
  - [ ] Play audio pronunciation
  - [ ] User speaks the word
  - [ ] Speech recognition validates
- [ ] **Sentence Mode**: Full sentences with vocabulary
  - [ ] Display complete sentence
  - [ ] Highlight target vocabulary
  - [ ] User speaks entire sentence
  - [ ] Color-coded feedback (like dictation)

#### Spaced Repetition Algorithm
- [ ] Implement SRS intervals (1, 3, 7, 14 days, etc.)
- [ ] Track per-user, per-word progress
- [ ] Failed attempts reset interval
- [ ] Success based on speech accuracy

#### Speech-First Features (CRITICAL)
- [ ] **Question Types** (all with speech):
  - [ ] "Wie sagt man [English] auf Deutsch?" â†’ Speak German
  - [ ] "Was bedeutet [German sentence]?" â†’ Speak translation
  - [ ] "Verwende [word] in einem Satz" â†’ Create & speak sentence
- [ ] **Audio Feedback**:
  - [ ] Immediate playback of correct pronunciation
  - [ ] Slow/normal speed options
- [ ] **No Typing Required** - all answers via speech

#### Video Integration
- [ ] Link vocabulary to source video & timestamp
- [ ] "Jump to video" feature for context
- [ ] Extract sentences containing target words

#### Additional Considerations
- [ ] Handle compound words (Zusammengesetzte WÃ¶rter)
- [ ] Word frequency influences initial difficulty
- [ ] Group related words (word families)
- [ ] Multiple mother language support
